## I thought algorithms were bad?

First off, that's more of a statement than an actual question, but... I'll allow it.

As a somewhat newer user of Mastodon myself, I understand the worry about the algorithms used to juice engagement on other social networks. However, providing access to a user-controlled summary of popular toots is *not* inherently evil. Personally, my main issue with algorithmic timelines is the corporate incentivizes to drive engagement to increase ad spend which drives revenue for billionaires which enables VCs to propagate unhealthy fairy tales about unicorns and capitalism. Also, the algorithms are a black-box and are forced on users without the ability to control or tweak them.

On the other hand, this website is completely separate from Mastodon and not pushed on anyone. You can skip it if it isn't useful. [This website is MIT-licensed](https://github.com/adamghill/fedigest) and the [original algorithm is BSD licensed](https://github.com/hodgesmr/mastodon_digest) if you are interested in the algorithm to find "populalar" posts and boosts.

My only hope is to provide more ways to find content on Mastodon -- not to sell ads.

## Where can I ask for a feature, report a bug, or send accolades?

Feel free to DM me [@adamghill](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill) or start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/adamghill/fedigest/discussions).

## I really love this tool, how can I help?

Thanks! I've been using it for a little while and really like it, so I hope it's useful for others. The best thing you can do is spread the word -- tell your friends who are on the fediverse, toot about it, make a vision board, etc.

Some other things that would be helpful:

- [fork the code and make improvements](https://github.com/adamghill/fedigest)
- [follow me on indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill)
- [sign up for DigitalOcean with my referral code](https://m.do.co/c/617d629f56c0) (it helps pay for my servers)
- [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/adamghill)

But, mostly work on that vision board. Thanks.
