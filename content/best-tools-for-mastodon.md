# The Best Tools for Mastodon in 2023

## Move from Twitter to Mastodon

- [Movetodon](https://www.movetodon.org): Log in with Twitter and movetodon will look at who you currently follow and find their Mastodon account. Will also show when they joined Mastodon and when they were last active. Made by [@Tibor](https://mastodon.social/@Tibor).

- [Followgraph](https://followgraph.vercel.app): Find awesome people on Mastodon by looking up who you follow on and surfacing who *they* follow. It expands your connection graph based on who you are already connected to. Made by [@gabipurcaru](https://mastodon.online/@gabipurcaru).

# Web clients

- [Elk](https://elk.zone/): A web-only interface for Mastodon that feels very similar to Twitter.
