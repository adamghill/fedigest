Here are the best tools for Mastodon I have found and personally used.

## Finding Servers

- [fedi.garden](https://fedi.garden/): Discovering nice servers on Mastodon and the fediverse. Made by [@FediGarden](https://social.growyourown.services/@FediGarden).
- [instances.social](https://instances.social/): A guided wizard that helps pick the right Mastodon instance for you. Made by [@TheKinrar](https://mastodon.xyz/@TheKinrar).

## Following Accounts

- [Followgraph](https://followgraph.vercel.app): Find awesome people on Mastodon by looking up who you follow on and surfacing who *they* follow. It expands your connection graph based on who you are already connected to. Made by [@gabipurcaru](https://mastodon.online/@gabipurcaru).

## Timeline Summaries

- [fediview](https://fediview.com): Aggregate the most popular posts from your timelines to get a personalized view of posts. Made by [@adamghill](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill/).
- [Feedseer](https://news.feedseer.com/): See the most popular links that have appeared in your Mastodon feed over the past day.

## Web Clients

Because `Mastodon` has a robust API anyone can create a different interface for browsing your network.

- [Elk](https://elk.zone): A web-only interface for Mastodon that feels very similar to Twitter.
- [tooty](https://n1k0.github.io/tooty/): An experimental multi-account Mastodon web client that is all client-side (no server needed!).
- [Phanpy](https://phanpy.social): A minimalist, opinionated Mastodon web client. Made by [@cheeaun](https://mastodon.social/@cheeaun).
- [Cuckoo](https://www.cuckoo.social/): A GooglePlus-Like third-party web client for mastodon.
- [feditrends](https://feditrends.com/): Aggregates what is trending across the fediverse.
- [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social): An alternative web client for Mastodon, focused on speed and simplicity. Made by [@nolan](https://toot.cafe/@nolan), but [unmaintained](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/01/09/retiring-pinafore/).

## Desktop Clients

- [Whalebird](https://whalebird.social): Slack-like UI for browsing Mastodon.
- [Sengi](https://nicolasconstant.github.io/sengi/): A multi-account Mastodon desktop client.
- [Elk Native](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk-native/releases): Still alpha, but a super slick desktop client from the same folks that build the web Elk client.

## Other Networks

These social networks bring something unique to your social network by focusing on a particular niche. They all integrate with `Mastodon` because they all use the same `ActivityPub` protocol.

- [BookWyrm](https://joinbookwyrm.com): A social network for tracking reading, talking about books, writing reviews, and discovering what to read next. Made by [@tripofmice](https://friend.camp/@tripofmice).
- [Pixeled](https://pixelfed.org): A network to explore and share beautiful photos and videos.
- [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org): PeerTube is a tool for sharing online videos.
