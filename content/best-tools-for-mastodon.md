# The Best Tools for Mastodon in 2023

Here are the best tools for Mastodon I have found and personally used. These should all be usable by non-technical folks from a web browser.

## Move from Twitter to Mastodon

- [Movetodon](https://www.movetodon.org): Log in with Twitter and movetodon will look at who you currently follow and find their Mastodon account. Will also show when they joined Mastodon and when they were last active. Made by [@Tibor](https://mastodon.social/@Tibor).
- [Followgraph](https://followgraph.vercel.app): Find awesome people on Mastodon by looking up who you follow on and surfacing who *they* follow. It expands your connection graph based on who you are already connected to. Made by [@gabipurcaru](https://mastodon.online/@gabipurcaru).

## Web clients

Because `Mastodon` has a robust API anyone can create a different interface for browsing your network.

- [Elk](https://elk.zone): A web-only interface for Mastodon that feels very similar to Twitter.
- [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social): An alternative web client for Mastodon, focused on speed and simplicity.
- [tooty](https://n1k0.github.io/tooty/): An experimental multi-account Mastodon web client that is all client-side (no server needed!).

## Misc tools

- [fediview](https://fediview.com): Aggregate the most popular posts from your timelines to get a personalized view of posts. Made by [@adamghill](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill/).

## Other networks

These social networks bring something unique to your social network by focusing on a particular niche. They all integrate with `Mastodon` because they all use the same `ActivityPub` protocol.

- [BookWyrm](https://joinbookwyrm.com): A social network for tracking reading, talking about books, writing reviews, and discovering what to read next. Made by [@tripofmice](https://friend.camp/@tripofmice).
- [Pixeled](https://pixelfed.org): A network to explore and share beautiful photos and videos.
